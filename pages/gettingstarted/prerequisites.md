Before you start to work with Harmony, you need to know and understand some concepts. Also it's important to have some background related with the platform. One of the greatest things of Harmony is that it allows to switch beetwen platforms very easy because the concepts are the same and the implementation is similar.

## Clean Architecture.
Harmony is based on clean architecture. Clean architecture has 3 different layers: **application**, **domain** and **data**. Each layer has one responsability. Also, they are connected to each other but they got boundaries. https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

### Application layer
//TODO: Link to each application layer

### Domain layer
[Domain](domain/interactor)

### Data layer
[Data](data/repository)

## Software

You need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for mobile platforms. For iOS or MacOS you also need [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed in your system.
